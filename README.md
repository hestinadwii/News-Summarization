# News-Summarization

This repository contains a project on summarizing news articles using a pre-trained language model and tokenizer. The model and tokenizer used are `wikipedia/t5-small`, fine-tuned for the task of text summarization. The goal of this project is to generate concise summaries of lengthy news articles effectively.

## Features
- Summarizes news articles into concise and coherent summaries.
- Utilizes the `wikipedia/t5-small` model and tokenizer for high-quality results.
- Fully customizable for additional datasets or different fine-tuning strategies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Datasets library
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the code interactively)
